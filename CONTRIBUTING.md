# Contributing to `qiskit-qasm2`

Thanks for your interest in contributing!  Please make sure you follow our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/jakelishman/qiskit-qasm2/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
at all times.

We're happy to accept help in a few forms:

- Bug reports (use [the bug tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/jakelishman/qiskit-qasm2/issues)).
- Helping answer questions in [existing bug reports](https://github.com/jakelishman/qiskit-qasm2/issues).
- Pull requests to fix bugs (but please file the bug report first).

For code changes, please make sure the code conforms to the code style of the
project (just run `tox -e style`), and that running the linter (`tox -e lint`)
doesn't show any errors.  All code changes should come with additional unit
tests if at all possible, and updated documentation if necessary.

This repository is quite likely to be vendored into Qiskit Terra at some point
in the future.  If you are contributing code, I will likely need to organise
your signature on [the contributor licensing agreement used by all Qiskit
projects](https://gist.github.com/jaygambetta/4ad0d9c0aa62a0b7c6b11bc89df7ee19).
